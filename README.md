# Sampled

The universal music player.

## Rationale

Coming soon...

Sampled is highly inspired by the [Meta music tag editor][meta] and [Doppler music player][doppler].

## Use

> [!NOTE]
>
> Sampled is in development and has limited feature support.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Sampled has not been notarized by Apple. To run the app, open the app and [follow these instructions][apple-notarization-bypass].

You can either download a release of the app from the [Releases][releases] page or build from source in Xcode.

macOS Sequoia (15) or later is required.

### Install

The first time you build the project (as well as make changes to configuration, like building for release), it will take
a significant amount of time to complete.[^1] This is due to project dependencies like FFmpeg. Subsequent builds should
perform much better.

1. Clone the Git repository (e.g., `git clone https://github.com/kyleerhabor/sampled Sampled`)
2. Open the project (e.g., `open Sampled/Sampled.xcodeproj`)
3. Select `Product > Archive` to build for release
4. From Organizer, select `Distribute App > Custom > Copy App` to export the app
5. Open the app

If you encounter an error like `'libavutil/avutil.h' file not found`, you may need to run `Tools/setup.sh` before step 3.

[^1]: An initial build on my 2019 MacBook Pro takes ~4 minutes to complete.
